## üì¶ HOW TO SPLIT YOUR 823 MB FILE

I'll create a script to split your files properly. Each part will be ~165-200 MB.

### PowerShell Script to Create 5 Parts:

```powershell
# Navigate to your folder
cd "f:\AI\1. Prompt Engineering"

# Create temporary directory for organizing
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "split_bundles" -Force

# PART 1: Characters 1-20 + Documentation (includes README & License)
$files1 = Get-ChildItem "halloween_characters_transparent\halloween_character_0??.png" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '0[0-1][0-9]|020' }
$files1 += Get-Item "LICENSE_AGREEMENT.txt", "CUSTOMER_README.txt"
Compress-Archive -Path $files1 -DestinationPath "split_bundles\Halloween_Bundle_Part1of5.zip" -CompressionLevel Optimal

# PART 2: Characters 21-40
$files2 = Get-ChildItem "halloween_characters_transparent\halloween_character_0??.png" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '02[1-9]|03[0-9]|040' }
Compress-Archive -Path $files2 -DestinationPath "split_bundles\Halloween_Bundle_Part2of5.zip" -CompressionLevel Optimal

# PART 3: Characters 41-60
$files3 = Get-ChildItem "halloween_characters_transparent\halloween_character_0??.png" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '04[1-9]|05[0-9]|060' }
Compress-Archive -Path $files3 -DestinationPath "split_bundles\Halloween_Bundle_Part3of5.zip" -CompressionLevel Optimal

# PART 4: Characters 61-80
$files4 = Get-ChildItem "halloween_characters_transparent\halloween_character_0??.png" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '06[1-9]|07[0-9]|080' }
Compress-Archive -Path $files4 -DestinationPath "split_bundles\Halloween_Bundle_Part4of5.zip" -CompressionLevel Optimal

# PART 5: Characters 81-100
$files5 = Get-ChildItem "halloween_characters_transparent\halloween_character_*.png" | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '08[1-9]|09[0-9]|100' }
Compress-Archive -Path $files5 -DestinationPath "split_bundles\Halloween_Bundle_Part5of5.zip" -CompressionLevel Optimal

Write-Host "`n‚úÖ DONE! 5 ZIP files created in 'split_bundles' folder"
Write-Host "Each file is approximately 165 MB"
