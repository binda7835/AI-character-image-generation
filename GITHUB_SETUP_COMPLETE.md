## 📋 What's NOT Uploaded (By Design)

### Excluded Files (.gitignore):

**Image Files (Too Large for GitHub):**
- ❌ `halloween_characters/*.png` (800+ MB)
- ❌ `halloween_characters_transparent/*.png` (800+ MB)
- ❌ `etsy_mockups/*.png` (100+ MB)
- ❌ `*.gif`, `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`

**Bundle Files:**
- ❌ `*.zip` (Halloween_Character_Bundle.zip - 824 MB)

**Generated PDFs:**
- ❌ `CUSTOMER_DOWNLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.pdf`

**Why?** GitHub has file size limits, and these are output files that users generate themselves.

**Result:** Your repo is lean (~555 KB total) and focused on code/docs!

## 💡 Pro Tips for GitHub

### 1. Write Good Commit Messages

```

### 2. Use Branches for Experiments

git checkout main
git merge experimental-feature

# If it fails, delete it
git branch -d experimental-feature
```

### 3. Check Status Often

```bash
git status  # See what's changed
git diff    # See exact changes
