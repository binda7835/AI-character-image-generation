2. ✅ Upload all 10 images in optimal order
3. ✅ Upload video (etsy_preview.gif)
4. ✅ Set price to $19.99

3. Share in relevant Facebook groups (craft groups, POD groups)
4. Pin to Pinterest with keyword-rich description
5. Post on Instagram with Halloween hashtags

**Day 2-7:**
1. Monitor your stats (views, favorites, cart adds)
2. Adjust if needed (but give it time!)
3. Continue promoting
4. Consider running Etsy Ads (more on this below)

### First Sale Strategy:

**Option 2:** Offer a launch discount
- 20% off for first 24 hours

---

## 🔟 ETSY ADS (Optional but Powerful)

### Should You Use Etsy Ads?

**For New Listings:** YES! (Short-term)

**Budget Recommendation:**
```
$5-10 per day for first 7 days
Then evaluate performance
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gets immediate visibility
- Etsy favors listings with ad spend
- You can turn it off anytime
- Only pay when someone clicks

## 1️⃣8️⃣ COMMON SEO MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T DO THESE:

**1. Keyword Stuffing**

```

**2. Copying Competitors Exactly**
```
❌ Copy top seller's title word-for-word

```

✅ Clean, professional, shows value clearly
```

**5. Incomplete Listings**
```
❌ Skip attributes, short description, few photos
✅ Fill out EVERYTHING completely
```

**6. Not Utilizing All 13 Tags**
```
❌ Only use 5-6 tags
✅ Use all 13 tags (free SEO!)
```

**7. Pricing Too Low**
```
❌ $3.99 (looks cheap/low quality)
✅ $19.99 (shows value)
```

**8. No Video**
```
❌ Skip video upload
✅ Always add video when possible (you have one!)
```

**9. Never Updating**
```
