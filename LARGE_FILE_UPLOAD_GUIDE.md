# ÔøΩ SECURE FILE DELIVERY GUIDE FOR ETSY
## How to Safely Share Large Files Without Public Links

## ‚úÖ YOU CAN UPLOAD YOUR 823 MB FILE!

Etsy **DOES** allow large ZIP files for digital downloads. Here's how:

---

## üéØ ETSY'S ACTUAL LIMITS

### Digital File Upload Limits:
- **Individual file limit:** 20 MB per file *inside* the ZIP
- **ZIP file total limit:** Up to **5 GB** (5,000 MB)
- **Your file:** 823.92 MB ‚úÖ (Well under the limit!)

### Why You're Seeing the Error:

The "20 MB limit" message appears when:
1. ‚ùå You're trying to upload in the wrong place
2. ‚ùå You're uploading to "Photos" instead of "Digital Files"
3. ‚ùå Your browser/connection is timing out
4. ‚ùå Etsy's uploader is having issues

---

## üìã CORRECT UPLOAD METHOD

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Create Your Listing First**
- Go to: Shop Manager ‚Üí Listings ‚Üí Add a listing
- Fill in basic info (title, description, price, etc.)
- **Important:** Select "Digital file" as the product type

#### 2. **Scroll to "Digital Files" Section**
- This is DIFFERENT from the "Photos" section at the top
- Look for section labeled: **"Digital files"** or **"Files"**
- It's usually near the bottom of the listing page

#### 3. **Upload Your ZIP File**
- Click **"Add a file"** button
- Select: `Halloween_Character_Bundle.zip` (823.92 MB)
- **Wait patiently** - large files take time!

#### 4. **Upload Time Estimate**
```
Your file: 823.92 MB
Average upload speed: 5-10 Mbps

Estimated time:
- Fast connection (10+ Mbps): 10-15 minutes
- Medium connection (5 Mbps): 20-30 minutes  
- Slow connection (2 Mbps): 45-60 minutes
```

#### 5. **During Upload**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DON'T close the browser tab**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DON'T refresh the page**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DON'T navigate away**
- ‚úÖ Let it complete fully

#### 6. **After Upload**
- You'll see: "1 file uploaded"
- File name will appear: `Halloween_Character_Bundle.zip`
- Click "Save" to save the listing

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING UPLOAD ISSUES

### Problem 1: "File too large" error

**Solution A - Use Etsy's Desktop (Not Mobile):**
- Mobile app has stricter limits
- Use desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

**Solution B - Clear Browser Cache:**
```
Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear browsing data
Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear cookies and cache
Edge: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear browsing data
```

**Solution C - Try Different Browser:**
- If Chrome fails, try Firefox
- If Firefox fails, try Edge
- Sometimes one works better than others

**Solution D - Disable Browser Extensions:**
- Ad blockers can interfere
- VPNs can cause issues
- Try Incognito/Private mode

### Problem 2: Upload Keeps Failing

**Solution A - Split Into Multiple Downloads:**
Even though Etsy allows 5 GB, you can upload multiple smaller files:

**Option 1: Two ZIP files (Recommended if upload fails)**
- Part 1: Characters 1-50 + License + README (~412 MB)
- Part 2: Characters 51-100 (~412 MB)

**Option 2: Three ZIP files**
- Part 1: Characters 1-33 (~275 MB)
- Part 2: Characters 34-66 (~275 MB)
- Part 3: Characters 67-100 + License + README (~275 MB)

To create split ZIPs, I can help you with a script.

**Solution B - Use Etsy's Alternative Method:**
Some sellers report success by:
1. Creating listing with a small dummy file first
2. Publishing the listing
3. Going back to edit
4. Replacing with large file

### Problem 3: Upload Times Out

**Solution A - Stable Connection:**
- Use wired ethernet (not WiFi) if possible
- Close other programs using internet
- Pause other downloads/uploads
- Upload during off-peak hours (early morning)

**Solution B - Upload in Sections:**
- Upload one section
- Save
- Edit listing
- Add another section
