**Day 2-7:**
1. Monitor your stats (views, favorites, cart adds)

3. Continue promoting
4. Consider running Etsy Ads (more on this below)

### First Sale Strategy:

## üîü ETSY ADS (Optional but Powerful)

### Should You Use Etsy Ads?

**For New Listings:** YES! (Short-term)

**Budget Recommendation:**
```
$5-10 per day for first 7 days
Then evaluate performance
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gets immediate visibility
- Etsy favors listings with ad spend
- You can turn it off anytime

## 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ COMMON SEO MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THESE:

**1. Keyword Stuffing**
```
‚ùå "Halloween clipart halloween png halloween graphics halloween bundle halloween"
‚úÖ Natural, readable text with keywords
```

**2. Copying Competitors Exactly**
```
‚ùå Copy top seller's title word-for-word
‚úÖ Use similar keywords but make it unique
```

**3. Ignoring Long-Tail Keywords**
```
‚ùå Only target "halloween clipart" (too competitive)
‚úÖ Also target "transparent halloween character bundle commercial use"
```

**4. Poor First Image**
```
‚ùå Cluttered, unclear, no text
‚úÖ Clean, professional, shows value clearly
```

**5. Incomplete Listings**
```
‚ùå Skip attributes, short description, few photos
‚úÖ Fill out EVERYTHING completely
```

**6. Not Utilizing All 13 Tags**
```
‚ùå Only use 5-6 tags
‚úÖ Use all 13 tags (free SEO!)
```

**7. Pricing Too Low**
```
‚ùå $3.99 (looks cheap/low quality)
‚úÖ $19.99 (shows value)
```

**8. No Video**
```
‚ùå Skip video upload
‚úÖ Always add video when possible (you have one!)
```

**9. Never Updating**
```
‚ùå Set it and forget it
‚úÖ Optimize monthly based on performance
```

**10. Ignoring Mobile**
```
‚ùå Don't check how it looks on phone
‚úÖ 70% of Etsy traffic is mobile - optimize for it!
